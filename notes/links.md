# to test

* try returning in set scalar parameter if the parameter does not exist.this is used widely and although not in tick everywhere its still a lot to update.
* add LOD to the vechile mesh.
* reduce shadow map size and quality, especilly check what on the vehicles casts shadows and if it can be LODed properly.
* remove forcing dbuffer. decals are a bit expensive.
* find a way to not update niagara! sparks and shit need to fly but not if its not visible and NOT if its on a fucking checkpoint thats not visible. focus on vehicles for now though.
* profile render thread properly WITH RHITread enabled. is this the bottleneck?
